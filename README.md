<div align="center"> <h1><strong>ðŸŽµ Spotify Visualizer ðŸŽµ</strong></h1> </div>

This is a rewritten version in TypeScript of my previous Spotify Visualizer, originally written in pure JavaScript.

**Note**: This is an underway project (Check <a href="#todos">TODOs</a>)

<sub>Original project inspired from [here](https://github.com/lukefredrickson/spotify-led-visualizer).</sub>

# About the project and goals
The goal of this project is to provide a centralized, modular and scalable spotify visualizer.

The API processing is delegated to a central server while multiple custom visualizers can visualize the song interpretation as they see fit (e.g. a ws2812b LED strip connected to a Raspberry Pi, a web page that changes the background color accordingly, etc.)

There would also be a WebApp where parameters and color schemes can be changed for each individual visualizer connected to the server.

#### My main issue when developing this
I want to keep this as simple as posible, so *anyone* can just follow a dummy guide and copy paste 40 lines of code to have a highly customizable visualizer at home, without any major complications. 

However, some features such as making X degrees color jumps, or saving visualizer profiles become very difficult as the server somehow need to have specific client information that can only be given out by the client voluntarily. This means adding extra communication from the client that needs to be coded manually, which in term adds extra complexity, thus straying from the initial goal of this project.

To overcome this I have planned on adding these features as optional features so that more advanced users can take the full advantage of this project, while not letting down people that just want to see some fancy lights blinking. If you have any advice or idea please let me know!

# Features
- Spotify API token refresh on each individual session
- A simple webapp for token authorization flow in spotify
- A backend for the Spotify API processing in nodejs
- Song Beat and Section synchronization
- Beat and Section confidence filtering
- Reactiveness to the song, meaning color jumps are larger during the chorus, for example
<br><br/>

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Spotify account
- node
  - npm/pnpm (node packet manager)
<br><br/>
## Dependencies
Install all node dependencies executing this in the root directory
```console
npm install
```
<br><br/>
Then create a ```.env``` in the root folder with the following keys:
```
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
```
And fill the values with your spotify client ID and Secret 

You can get them [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications), creating an app and copying the client ID and Client Secret from the page
<br><br/>
## Usage
The server can be executed with:
```console
npm start
```

Or compiled with:
```console
tsc
```

# TODOs
- [x] Implement color cycling
- [x] Implement token refresh in mid-playback
- [x] Figure out a way to delegate the song interpretation to the server
- [x] Add support for multiple visualizers
- [x] Implement socket communication
- [x] Implement individual visualizer customization
- [x] Make color jump related to song attributes
- [x] Standardize the message exchanges from server to visualizers
- [x] Add parameter for brightness
- [ ] Fix color palette creations so the colors chosen are more predominant
- [ ] Add option for in color palette jump (just shift)
- [ ] Solve missing song attributes bug when song changes
- [ ] Solve colors flickering when song changes
- [ ] Implement reliable over network communication
- [ ] Fine tune palette sizes
- [ ] Optimize beat steps to omit the beats lower that then confidence threshold
- [ ] Make the webapp for parameters tweaking
- [ ] Code clean-up (duh)
